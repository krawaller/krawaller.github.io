Testing Backbone applications isn't easy, so kudos to the authors for devoting a chapter to the subject. However, one of the traps in testing Backbone code is to fail to differentiate between testing your own code and testing Backbone itself. This book does nothing to remedy that, as their testing examples fall into this exact trap.
