'),n.a.createElement("p",null,'As given away by the title, Stoyan\'s book is organised in a similar fashion. Here, however, the mold fits the text like a glove.

Recipes, you could say, or phrases, if you\'re in a worse mood. While interesting on an academic level, I rarely looked up from one of those articles thinking "hey, I can use this".

This, however, means focusing on a classical approach borrowed from languages with strong types and interfaces. We might be feeling at home with that, but we would be better off embracing JavaScript's dynamic, loosely typed nature, and find solutions that work best in this environment. This is what JSP provides. And, JSP discusses \"patterns\" in a broader sense - where PJSDP is only concerned with design patterns, JSP hovers higher and also talks about coding patterns, meaning paradigms in a wider sense; best practices, work flows, approaches, etc. I will continue to enjoy PJSDP, but JSP is where I'll go for real-world help.")),n.a.createElement("li",null,n.a.createElement("p",null,n.a.createElement("em",null,"High Performance JavaScript"),": There is some overlap here, as JSP adresses some patterns regarding performance.

JPS is way more succinct, and because it assumes you already have a good foundation, it can afford the luxury of high-level discussion.
